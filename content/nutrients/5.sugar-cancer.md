# Sugar & Cancer, what's the link?

A lot of things are being said about cancer and sugar and you have already heard about it, but what is true?

So let's clear up this confusion.

## How we got here
Over the years, plenty of information has been gathered on the topic online. However, not very much of this is based on scientific evidence.

Over the past few months, I have been getting a lot of information regarding the topic. This is often followed or preceded by an image or other type of media such as below

## How the body gets energy-Sugars
Sugar comes in a variety of forms, from simple sugars such as **glucose**  to complex forms like **Polysaccharides** which are a alarge part of starchy foods like rice, brwad and pasta. 
It is important to understand how the body gets energy before we move on.


The body is made up of different kinds of cells performing different functions such as nerve cells for feeling and muscle cells for movement.

All these cells require energy to carry out their functions. This energy is essentially derived from glucose after it is broken down, in a process called glycolysis. In the absence of glucose or sugars, protein and fat can be used to dervive energy.

## Dependencies

Next, go to to `my-blog/` directory and install the dependencies:

```bash

```

Next, you can start creating your content in Markdown in the `content/` directory.


## Deploy

### Static hosting

You can deploy Alpine to any static hosting by running the following command:

```bash
npm run generate
```

This command will create a `dist/` directory with the compiled files ready to be uploaded to any static hosting.

### Edge platforms

Alpine supports deploying to the following platforms with **zero configuration**:

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
- [and more...](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/deploy/presets#supported-hosting-providers)

### Node server

You can deploy Alpine to a Node server by running the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will create a `.output/` directory with the compiled files ready to be uploaded to any Node server.

To start the production server, run the following command:

```bash
node .output/server/index.mjs
```
